# Analyzing-_Google_App-
In this project, our goal is to figure out what types of apps tend to be popular on the Google Play Store. We work for a company that makes free apps and earns money through ads. By understanding which app categories are in high demand, we can help our developers create apps that attract more users and generate more revenue.
